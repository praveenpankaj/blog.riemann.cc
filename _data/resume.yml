  summary: >
    I am keen to deepen my knowledge in technology policy to help constructing
    bridges to overcome the digital divide in the new age of information.
    After my PhD studies in Lyon, I joined the IT Policy team of the European
    Data Protection Supervisor in Brussels. In the future, I want to continue to
    shape technology policy in Europe.
